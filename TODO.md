* Improve readme.
* More tests.
* Better encapsulation of LinearCombination.
* Prettier printing of coefficients.
* Alternatives to unicode operators (maybe using #, § or some such).
* Exact math to avoid almost-zero blades that should be zero.
* Use Template Haskell to symbolically calculate products between different GA objects. (Big undertaking!)
